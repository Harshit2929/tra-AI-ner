## Problem statement
One of the problems that we identified in these covid times was that due to reduced physical activity has caused many psychological and physical health issues. Physical activities (PA) and exercise are very essential for one's well being as they not only maintain physical and psychological health but also help our body to respond to the negative consequences of several diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases.

Even World Health Organization (WHO) has advised adults to accumulate at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity during the week, and additional muscle strengthening activities on two or more days a week (WHO, 2018).Population-based survey studies for example showed that those who exercise at least two to three times a week, report significantly less stress, cynical distrust, and anger than less active individuals.Thereby we thought that solving this problem was necessary due to it's such as building a home workout application will surely solve and we hope we will our project gives a positive impact to society.

## Solution

In order to solve this problem we have built a web application where we will give user real time feedback on of user's exercises both for yoga poses and workout exercises.A game has also been built in whhich the users using his hand movements has to destroy the obstacle coming his way.This game will help motivate users to exercise and have fun tooðŸ˜œ. 
Streaks have also been added so that user remains motivated and doesn't leave a day without exercising.We have also integrated music player in our web app so that users can exercise and play their favourite song hand in hand in our app.
